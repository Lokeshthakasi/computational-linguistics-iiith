The most important functionalities observed are :
1) There is a dropdown menu to select the languages that are present.
2) The Words that are displayed is of button type.
3) The "Reform-the sentence" button functionality is put the words back in the initial position how it is .
4) The "Check the correctness" functionality is  to check the correctness of the sentence we selected whether it is syntatically and semantically correct or not
5) If the formed sentence is wrong , then "get the correct answers" button is invoked to see the right answers.
6) Clicking on the button to get the right answers, the possible answers are also generated.
7) Apart from these above features,it would be helpful if we have a undo button so that we can imagine what word to be followed to make a complete sense , rather taking the whole sentence to get reformed.
8) There can be also a button to reveal the possible right answers if exists, even after the correct answer is given.
